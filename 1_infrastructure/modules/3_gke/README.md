# GKE Module
Dual region architecture with 1 active and 1 passive region.
Dual-region architecture with one active GKE cluster and another passive behind a single Global External HTTPS Load Balancer IP.

## Overview and purpose
A lean, reliable active/passive deployment pattern for two GKE clusters in different regions with a mechanism for traffic failover.

## Core ideas and design
- Use one active cluster to serve traffic normally, and one passive as standby.
- Use a Global External HTTPS Load Balancer (GCLB) with a single anycast IP as a frontend, and backends in both regions.
- LBâ€™s health checks determine which backend serves traffic - When the active region fails health checks, the LB sends traffic to the healthy passive region automatically. (Cloud Load Balancing uses health checks to mark backends healthy or unhealthy and will stop sending traffic to unhealthy backends.)

## High-level design
- Single Global External HTTPS Load Balancer with one IP in frontend.
- Each GKE cluster exports NEGs for the same Service. NEGs from both regions are attached to a single global BackendService.
- GCLB health checks determine backend health. Unhealthy backends stop receiving traffic.
- Passive cluster kept with small baseline capacity and reduced from normal traffic path via backend configuration (capacity scaler and backend weights).
- Autoscaling with Cluster Autoscaler and HPA handles scale-up under failover load.

## Key components
- Frontend - single global HTTPS IP provisioned in the networking module.
- Backends - each GKE cluster exposes the application via NEGs.
- Failover - GCLB uses health checks. If active backends are unhealthy, traffic goes to passive backends.
- Changeover and tuning - control capacity per backend via backend service backend configuration - passive region is kept out of the normal traffic path until needed.

## Pre-warming and scaling passive cluster when required
- Keep small baseline in passive region - i.e. small node pool and minimal replica count, so pods start quickly on failover.
- Use Cluster Autoscaler and HPA to scale under load.

## Resources created via GKE module
- Clusters, node pools, autoscaling rules
- Ingress, NEG exports, BackendService config - backends, capacity_scaler, health checks
- Outputs - NEG names, backend group identifiers, region-specific endpoints
